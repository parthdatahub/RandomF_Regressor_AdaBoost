# Random Forest Regressor and AdaBoost

Random Forest Regressor and AdaBoost are both ensemble learning algorithms used for regression tasks. Random Forest Regressor builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to make the final regression output. AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, iteratively trains weak learners and combines their predictions to create a strong learner. This repository provides an overview of both algorithms and their application in regression tasks.

## Random Forest Regressor and AdaBoost Interview Questions

1. **What is Ensemble Learning?**
   Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance and generalization ability.

2. **What is the basic idea behind Random Forest Regressor?**
   Random Forest Regressor builds multiple decision trees using random subsets of the training data and random subsets of features. It aggregates the predictions of these trees to make the final regression output.

3. **What are the hyperparameters in Random Forest Regressor?**
   Random Forest Regressor has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize its performance, including:
   - Number of trees (n_estimators)
   - Maximum depth of trees (max_depth)
   - Minimum number of samples required to split a node (min_samples_split)
   - Minimum number of samples required in a leaf node (min_samples_leaf)

4. **How does Random Forest Regressor handle overfitting?**
   Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees due to ensemble learning. The averaging of multiple trees helps to reduce the impact of noisy data and overfitting.

5. **What is the basic idea behind AdaBoost?**
   AdaBoost is an iterative algorithm that sequentially trains weak learners and adjusts the weights of misclassified instances. It combines the predictions of these weak learners to create a strong learner.

6. **What are weak learners in AdaBoost?**
   Weak learners are simple and relatively low-complexity models, such as decision stumps (decision trees with a single split). These learners have only modest predictive power but perform better than random guessing.

7. **What are the hyperparameters in AdaBoost?**
   AdaBoost has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize its performance, including:
   - Number of estimators (n_estimators): The maximum number of weak learners to be combined.
   - Learning rate: Controls the contribution of each weak learner to the final prediction.

8. **What is the role of data weighting in AdaBoost?**
   AdaBoost assigns higher weights to misclassified instances, allowing subsequent weak learners to focus on the most challenging samples and improve overall performance.

9. **When should you use Random Forest Regressor over AdaBoost for regression tasks?**
   Random Forest Regressor is suitable when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex non-linear relationships. It provides robustness against overfitting and typically requires fewer hyperparameter tunings. AdaBoost, on the other hand, is useful when dealing with simpler models or when you want to sequentially focus on challenging instances to improve performance.
